            The player shooting the dice is the first to bet and the other players must at least match his bet before the game can continue. If the bet cannot be matched, the shooter can either lower the bet to accommodate the other players, or handicap the odds.

            It's pretty standard to charge $0.50 to $1.00 for individual dice. If you need a lot of dice you can get much better deals buying in bulk though.
